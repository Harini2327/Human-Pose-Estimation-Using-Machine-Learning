# Human-Pose-Estimation-Using-Machine-Learning
This project is all about detecting and understanding how people move by analyzing their body positions using machine learning. It identifies key points on the body, like the head, shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees, and turns them into a stick-figure overlay on photos or videos. It’s a simple yet powerful way to visually track body movements.

The system works with both pictures and live video, making it flexible for different uses. For example, you can use it to monitor fitness routines, study sports techniques, assist in physical therapy, or even control games using gestures.

Here’s how it works: you provide an input, like a photo or video. The system uses a machine learning model (like Mediapipe) to find and map key body points into a stick-figure skeleton. If it’s a live video, it tracks movements in real-time, so you can see how someone is moving dynamically, whether they’re dancing, doing yoga, or exercising.

The project uses tools like OpenCV (for handling images) and Mediapipe (for detecting body landmarks). It’s designed to be beginner-friendly but still capable of powering creative and interactive projects. You could build a fitness tracking app, analyze athletic performance, or even experiment with gesture-controlled systems.

Whether you’re just starting with machine learning or looking for a fun project to explore human movement analysis, this is a great way to dive into the fascinating world of pose estimation! It’s practical, easy to understand, and packed with potential for innovation.
